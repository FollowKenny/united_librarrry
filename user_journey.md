# Robert Journey

1. Robert launchs the app/site
2. Robert gets a loading screen with teamco logo if loading time is required
3. Robert reaches the sign in/up screen that offers several possibilities (usual id provider and classical email password).
4. Robert chooses one (suppose email/password for now)
5. Robert is presented with the a form for his email password and a button for signing up and a button for signing in
6. Robert chooses sign up (if not registered) or sign in (if already registered)
7. Robert is presented with a home page which is an app bar, a list of its previously created library a button to toggle fusion view, and a button to create a library
8. Robert clicks on the button create library
9. Robert is presented with a 1/2 screen with a form for library title and library additional field with a plus button and finally a create button
10. Robert fills the form and press the plus button that adds the named field above in a list view with a minus button. If Roberts adds another field the same thing happens with maximum 25 fields in total
11. If Roberts hits the minus button it removes the associated field
12. When Roberts press the plus button, a new library is displayed on his home page and the 1/2 screen disappear
13. If Roberts had pressed on the top half screen (or swipe down or any other method), the create widget would have been canceled

17. Robert clicks on a tile
18. Robert is presented with a screen with the tile details organized from top to bottom with the mandatory field then custom fields. Some clever representation is left to be thought
19. On this screen Roberts can edit fields (and cannot blank mandator fields).
20. A little arrow in the app bar allows Robert to retrieve his previous screen (the browsed library)
